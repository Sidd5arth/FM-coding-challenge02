### What I learned

Basically I refreshed my vanilla coding skills by tooking this and doing it without using any framework or libraries which I hadn't done in a while.


If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I think I would love to build some more projects with vanilla coding!!
